# Deployment Checklist

## Pre-Deployment Verification

### ✅ Code Quality
- [x] All ESLint warnings and errors resolved
- [x] TypeScript compilation successful
- [x] Production build successful
- [x] No console.error statements in client code (server-side logging retained)
- [x] No debug code or TODO comments

### ✅ API Routes
- [x] Moved database operations from client to server-side API
- [x] Comprehensive input validation implemented
- [x] Proper error handling with sanitized responses
- [x] Environment variable validation
- [x] Type-safe request/response handling

### ✅ Security
- [x] Environment variables properly configured
- [x] Database credentials server-side only
- [x] Input validation and sanitization
- [x] Error responses don't expose internal details
- [x] .env files properly gitignored

### ✅ Configuration
- [x] .env.example file created with required variables
- [x] README updated with deployment instructions
- [x] Package.json scripts configured
- [x] Database setup scripts documented

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Environment Variables
Set these in your deployment platform:
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
```

### 2. Database Setup
Run these commands after deployment:
```bash
npm run setup:db    # Create tables
npm run seed:test   # (Optional) Add test data
npm run check:db    # Verify setup
```

### 3. Vercel Deployment (Recommended)
1. Push code to GitHub
2. Connect repository to Vercel
3. Add environment variables in dashboard
4. Deploy

### 4. Alternative Platforms
Ensure your platform supports:
- Node.js 18+
- API routes (/api/*)
- Environment variables
- Build command: `npm run build`
- Start command: `npm run start`

## Post-Deployment Testing

### Test Checklist
- [ ] Home page loads with player list
- [ ] Individual player pages display correctly
- [ ] Submit Record button opens modal
- [ ] Tournament submission works with meta decks
- [ ] Tournament submission works with custom Pokemon
- [ ] Form validation displays appropriate errors
- [ ] API returns proper success/error responses

### API Endpoint Testing
Test the API directly:
```bash
curl -X POST https://your-domain.com/api/tournament-records \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "playerName": "Test Player",
    "date": "2025-01-01",
    "wins": 3,
    "losses": 2,
    "ties": 0,
    "selectedDeck": 1
  }'
```

## Monitoring

### Key Metrics to Monitor
- API response times
- Error rates on /api/tournament-records
- Database connection health
- Build/deployment success rates

### Common Issues
- **Database connection**: Verify Supabase credentials
- **API failures**: Check server logs for validation errors
- **Build failures**: Ensure all dependencies are in package.json

## Rollback Plan
If issues occur:
1. Revert to previous deployment in platform dashboard
2. Check environment variables are correctly set
3. Verify database connectivity
4. Review server logs for errors

## Production Architecture

### Client-Side (Browser)
- React components for UI
- Form handling and validation
- API calls to backend
- Read-only database queries for display

### Server-Side (API Routes)
- Tournament record submission
- Database write operations
- Input validation and sanitization
- Error handling and logging

### Database (Supabase)
- Player management
- Tournament results storage
- Pokemon deck archetypes
- Automated backups

## Performance Optimizations Applied
- Static page generation where possible
- Optimized bundle size (155kB first load)
- Debounced Pokemon search
- Efficient database queries
- Proper TypeScript compilation

**Status: ✅ Ready for Production Deployment**
